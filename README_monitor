Installation Python module on Linux
easy_install --upgrade setuptools
easy_install email


I use the Ubuntu 16.04 version and Python 3.5.2.


I use os.walk() to utilizes generators to recursively walk through the file system. 
And then generate all filenames in a directory tree that match a *.log file. 
gen_cat function concatenate items from one or more source into a single sequence of items.

I set my email addresses as default.
Once the program parsing "error" ,then it will send email from my gmail to my school email account.
It needs to enter the password. 
The default email could be changed if I have spefic target: who I should send, what email address should I use. 
It would need not asking user to enter password by stdin everytime. 
  

Execute:

python3 monitor.py 

if there is error in log file then the program will require you to enter the password or each warning.
